# xFGv2 iOS Trading Notifications App - Implementation Plan

## 📱 App Overview

**Name**: StructuralAlerts (or similar)  
**Target**: Professional traders who need instant, secure notifications for structural level breaks  
**Unique Value**: Real-time alerts based on proprietary xFGv2 structural level analysis  

## 🎯 Market Opportunity

### Unmet Need
- Current solutions (TradingView, broker apps) lack sophisticated structural analysis
- No secure, private notification system for custom trading algorithms
- Professional traders willing to pay premium for edge

### Revenue Model
- **Tier 1**: $29/month - Basic alerts (ES/NQ only)
- **Tier 2**: $79/month - Full suite (all futures, custom levels)
- **Tier 3**: $199/month - API access, white-label options

### Target Market Size
- 50,000+ active futures traders globally
- Capture 1% = 500 users = $23,500-99,500/month
